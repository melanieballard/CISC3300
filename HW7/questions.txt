2. Both PHP and JavaScript are interpreted languages, meaning they do not use a compiler to read and translate
the code into executable machine code, but are rather read and executed by an interpreter either on the browser or 
server the code is running on. Both languages are also dynamically typed, which makes the use of
variables more flexible by not explicitly determining their type at declaration. However, while both are used in web development, 
their specific roles differ. PHP is more useful for data manipulation, server side actions, and connection to databases like SQL.
