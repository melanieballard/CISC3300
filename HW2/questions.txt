1. Define structural vs semantic meaning in regard to HTML elements.
    Structural meaning changes the appearance of an element, while semantic meaning changes
    both the appearance and the meaning of the element. For example, <b> just makes text
    bold, while <strong> gives it both bold typeface and semantic importance.

2. Why is it important to use correct html elements when designing web pages?
    Different elements can be treated differently by browsers and screen readers. <em> and <i>
    might be read differently by screen readers, so using the correct tag is important for
    accessability. Following general conventions is always another good reason to use
    correct tags so that other developers can understand your code.

3. What are forms in html? What is their purpose? When would you use one?
    Forms are submission elements where users can input data and it can be sent to 
    another server to be saved or proccessed. Their purpose is to allow user input on websites.
    One reason to use a form would be for a username and password log in. Another reason could be for
    feedback or survey purposes.


4. Define and contrast inline vs block elements.
    Inline elements start on the previous line and do not create a line break. Block 
    elements always start on a new line when they are created.
