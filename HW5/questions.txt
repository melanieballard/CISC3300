4. What is the DOM? What is meant by the DOM tree?

DOM stands for Document Object Model and it represents the structure of a 
document (like an HTML file that represents a webpage) in memory. The representation
is formatted as a logical tree, with branches that end in nodes which contain objects, or HTML 
elements. The DOM allows programming languages like JavaScript to access elements of the tree and 
alter them or perform functions on them. 

5. What is a XSS attack? How do they work? How can you guard against them?

An XSS is a Cross-site scripting attack, which is when an attacker submits malicious code into a website 
form that takes script inputs. They work by manipulating otherwise reputable websites to access users
private data through the interactions they have with that website. The attacker can submit malicious code to a 
website that uses JavaScript to read user input and alter parts of the website based on that input. If a hacker
submits code that could reroute credit card number inputs to a secondary source rather than just the secure 
original website, this would be considered and XSS attack. Some ways to prevent XSS attacks are to screen any 
user inputs before they are executed to ensure they are valid. Another way to prevent them is to encode any user 
inputted data in a way where it would be unusable to any hacker who aquires it.
